# sas2ircu-status-py3
sas2ircu-status in python3

I was using sas2ircu-status in ubuntu20 and when i upgraded to ubuntu22 i found that this script broke.
I was unable to find updated packages, but it was obvious the script was broken because it was written for python2 which is not in ubuntu22.
I ran the script through a few AIs asking them to port it to python3. One of them gave me a working script, which I am sharing here for others who may need it.
